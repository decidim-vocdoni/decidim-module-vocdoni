# Decidim::Vocdoni

:warning: This module is under development and is not ready to be used in production.

An elections component for decidim's participatory spaces based on the [Vocdoni][vocdoni-app-url].

Vocdoni is a secure digital voting solution using decentralized technologies.
The voting protocol which powers the platform is designed to be universally verifiable,
secure, and resistant to attack and censorship through the use of blockchain technology,
together with decentralized technologies and cryptographic mechanisms, such as zero-knowledge proofs.

This will allow administrators to set-up elections in the Vocdoni blockchain (aka Vochain),
using the Vocdoni SDK.

## Usage

Vocdoni will be available as a Component for a Participatory Space.
