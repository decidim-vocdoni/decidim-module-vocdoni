# Decidim::Vocdoni

:warning: This module is under development and is not ready to be used in production.

An elections component for decidim's participatory spaces based on the [Vocdoni][vocdoni-app-url].

Vocdoni is a secure digital voting solution using decentralized technologies.
The voting protocol which powers the platform is designed to be universally verifiable,
secure, and resistant to attack and censorship through the use of blockchain technology,
together with decentralized technologies and cryptographic mechanisms, such as zero-knowledge proofs.

This will allow administrators to set-up elections in the Vocdoni blockchain (aka Vochain),
using the Vocdoni SDK.

## Usage

Vocdoni will be available as a Component for a Participatory Space.

## Installation

This module is only compatible with Decidim v0.27.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "decidim-vocdoni", github: "andreslucena/decidim-module-vocdoni"
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```

## Contributing

See [Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim).

### Developing

To start contributing to this project, first:

- Install the basic dependencies (such as Ruby and PostgreSQL)
- Clone this repository

Decidim's main repository also provides a Docker configuration file if you
prefer to use Docker instead of installing the dependencies locally on your
machine.

You can create the development app by running the following commands after
cloning this project:

```bash
$ bundle
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rake development_app
```

Note that the database user has to have rights to create and drop a database in
order to create the dummy test app database.

Then to test how the module works in Decidim, start the development server:

```bash
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bin/rails s
```

Note that `bin/rails` is a convinient wrapper around the command `cd development_app; bundle exec rails`.

In case you are using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and have the
[rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars) plugin installed for it, you
can add the environment variables to the root directory of the project in a file
named `.rbenv-vars`. If these are defined for the environment, you can omit
defining these in the commands shown above.

#### Webpacker notes

As latests versions of Decidim, this repository uses Webpacker for Rails. This means that compilation
of assets is required everytime a Javascript or CSS file is modified. Usually, this happens
automatically, but in some cases (specially when actively changes that type of files) you want to 
speed up the process. 

To do that, start in a separate terminal than the one with `bin/rails s`, and BEFORE it, the following command:

```
bin/webpack-dev-server
```

#### Code Styling

Please follow the code styling defined by the different linters that ensure we
are all talking with the same language collaborating on the same project. This
project is set to follow the same rules that Decidim itself follows.

[Rubocop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/) linter is used for the Ruby language.

You can run the code styling checks by running the following commands from the
console:

```
$ bundle exec rubocop
```

To ease up following the style guide, you should install the plugin to your
favorite editor, such as:

- Atom - [linter-rubocop](https://atom.io/packages/linter-rubocop)
- Sublime Text - [Sublime RuboCop](https://github.com/pderichs/sublime_rubocop)
- Visual Studio Code - [Rubocop for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/misogi/vscode-ruby-rubocop)

#### Non-Ruby Code Styling

There are other linters for Javascript and CSS. These run using NPM packages. You can
run the following commands:

1. `npm run lint`: Runs the linter for Javascript files.
2. `npm run lint-fix`: Automatically fix issues for Javascript files (if possible).
3. `npm run stylelint`: Runs the linter for SCSS files.
4. `npm run stylelint-fix`: Automatically fix issues for SCSS files (if possible).

### Testing

To run the tests run the following in the gem development path:

```bash
$ bundle
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rake test_app
$ DATABASE_USERNAME=<username> DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> bundle exec rspec
```

Note that the database user has to have rights to create and drop a database in
order to create the dummy test app database.

In case you are using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and have the
[rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars) plugin installed for it, you
can add these environment variables to the root directory of the project in a
file named `.rbenv-vars`. In this case, you can omit defining these in the
commands shown above.

### Test code coverage

Code coverage report is generated automatically in a folder named `coverage` in the project root which contains
the code coverage report.

```bash
firefox coverage/index.html
```
